<h2> Writing Asyncrnouse functions/Tasks in Python<h2>

Task that can be pause and resumed later as other task are waited on are called ascnconous task.
They are considered part of the concurrent implementation of functions.
Concurrent funtion implementations can also be Multi-threaded (run on multiple
thread)

Asynchronus functions are implemented to solve the problem of functions blocking each other if they were to be run one after another sychronously).
