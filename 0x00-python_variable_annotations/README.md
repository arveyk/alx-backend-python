<-- Python Variable Annoations -->

In this project we are exploring annotations in python.

These annotations are somehow a way of documenting code since they will not be
enforced during execution of the function

for example

x: int = 2

with out the annotation at runtime the assigment would infer that x is a variale that hold a number
